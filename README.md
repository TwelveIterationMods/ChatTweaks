# Chat Tweaks

_Chat Tweaks_ is a client-side mod that provides various tweaks and features to the Minecraft chat, while staying close to the look and feel of the Vanilla chat.

It's most notable features are Emoticons, image link preview, configurable chat tabs and message filters. It also provides an API for other mods to use and will act as the new base for my upcoming IRC & Twitch Integration mods.
